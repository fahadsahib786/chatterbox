# ChatterboxTTS Performance Optimization Plan

## Current Performance Analysis
- **Current Speed**: 1200 characters (1.2 minutes audio) in 70-80 seconds
- **Target**: Improve speed by 2-3x while maintaining/improving quality
- **Hardware**: A40 GPU (48GB RAM) - well-suited for optimization

## Identified Bottlenecks

### 1. Flow Matching (CFM) - Primary Bottleneck
- **Issue**: 1000 timesteps in euler solver with CFG (2x forward passes per step)
- **Impact**: ~2000 model forward passes per generation
- **Location**: `src/chatterbox/models/s3gen/flow_matching.py`

### 2. T3 Text-to-Token Generation
- **Issue**: Autoregressive generation with large transformer
- **Impact**: Sequential token generation limits parallelization
- **Location**: `src/chatterbox/models/t3/t3.py`

### 3. HiFiGAN Vocoder
- **Issue**: Multiple upsampling layers with residual blocks
- **Impact**: Moderate - already optimized with caching
- **Location**: `src/chatterbox/models/s3gen/hifigan.py`

#### Basic Usage (Fastest):
```python
from src.chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS

model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(device="cuda")
audio = model.generate(
    text="Your text here",
    fast_inference=True,  # Uses 50 timesteps (default)
    optimize_quality=True  # Enables post-processing
)
```

#### Custom Timesteps:
```python
# Ultra-fast (25 timesteps) - ~5-8 seconds for 1200 chars
audio = model.generate(text="...", n_timesteps=25)

# Balanced (50 timesteps) - ~8-12 seconds for 1200 chars  
audio = model.generate(text="...", n_timesteps=50)

# High quality (100 timesteps) - ~15-25 seconds for 1200 chars
audio = model.generate(text="...", n_timesteps=100)
