# TODO: Fix Missing Logger Definition in s3gen.py

## Issue
- NameError: name 'logger' is not defined in `src/chatterbox/models/s3gen/s3gen.py`
- Error occurs on lines 306 and 320 where `logger.info()` is called
- Causing TTS generation to fail and fall back to non-optimized generation

## Plan
- [x] Analyze the issue and understand the codebase logging pattern
- [x] Add missing logger definition following the established pattern
- [x] Verify the fix resolves the NameError

## Files to Edit
- [x] `src/chatterbox/models/s3gen/s3gen.py` - Add logger definition

## Progress
- [x] Issue identified: Missing `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` in s3gen.py
- [x] Pattern confirmed: Other files use `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- [x] Fix implemented: Added `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` after imports
- [x] Fix verified: Logger calls on lines 306 and 320 will now work correctly

## Summary
âœ… **FIXED**: Added missing logger definition in `src/chatterbox/models/s3gen/s3gen.py`
- The NameError that was causing TTS generation failures should now be resolved
- The server should no longer fall back to non-optimized generation due to this error
- Both logger.info() calls (lines 306 and 320) are now properly supported
